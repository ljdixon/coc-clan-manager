    <p>Welcome to Clan FOG, A fairly successful COC clan that was founded by some coworkers in western Pennsylvania, and continue today to try to keep it competitive and fun.</p>
	<p>We don&#39;t want to micro manage, but eventually we expect people to understand our general rules and strategy so that they can eventually make good decisions on their own.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>General clan comments:</b></p>
	<p>&nbsp; -&nbsp; Do not ask to be promoted.&nbsp; Redspec is the leader, and co-leaders are reserved for people who have admin functions in the clan or did in the past.&nbsp; Even promoted to elder is a big deal and proves you understand our tactics, perform well, get along, and have done plenty of time as a member. &nbsp;Just enjoy the clan, rank really isn&rsquo;t considered much here, it&rsquo;s about the game.&nbsp; Being a killer player is not a priority here, being reliable and timely is.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; In general we war in reference to time to the EST time zone, and tend to kick off wars around 8pm&nbsp;EST.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Do not request high level expensive troops for normal defense or for looting.&nbsp; Giants and some wizards are fine, but higher and dark elixir requests will probably go unfulfilled, unless you are in a war.&nbsp; Please donate no matter what level troops you have, try to keep an even ratio if you can.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Remember that FOG is a Clan Level 10+, so that means that all donations get a level bump of +2 and half the troop cost goes back into your bank.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Don&#39;t be a silent member, chat it up some.&nbsp; Good communication is the key to our success.&nbsp; Don&#39;t have a thin skin, people will be trying to help you and sarcasm and poking fun is a part of it, no one is trying to be mean here.&nbsp; Listen and learn.&nbsp; We do expect some improvement in warring.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>War strategy:</b></p>
	<p>In general, our strategy is to assign first attacks to be as efficient as possible on getting more 3 stars attacks in that first round than blindly going straight across or other methods.&nbsp; If you dont have an assignment then it usually means you are on cleanup and you will then look to take another members failed attack that you have a high percent chance of getting 3 stars.&nbsp; If you are near the top of the war rankings and are not assigned an attack, it is probably due to waiting for the enemy&rsquo;s war bases to be revealed at the start of war, before 1st attacks are decided.&nbsp; Second attacks are for cleaning (getting 3 stars) from the bottom up.&nbsp; So the lowest bases should be able to get both attacks in the first few hours of the war if everyone is timely.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; First attacks are assigned from our website <a href="http://www.clanfog.com">www.clanfog.com</a>. Get the login ASAP.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; IF YOU DO NOT 3 STAR ON YOUR FIRST ATTACK, YOU ARE EXPECTED TO ATTACK LOWER FOR YOUR SECOND ATTACK TO CLEANUP SOMEONE ELSE&#39;S FIRST ATTEMPT.&nbsp; Remember, one star or two stars is NOT good enough in this clan, we will need it 3 starred from another member.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; If you are in the top half of our war ranks, you must fill one or two war clan castles per the chart on the website.&nbsp; You must give what is requested.&nbsp; Max troops are not mandatory, so don&rsquo;t worry about your troop level.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t have what is asked for then ask someone for help.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t fill your required clan castles you may be asked to fill them all the next war you are in.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; In general we expect that at least all TH8s and lower OR the bottom half of the clan get both attacks in by 12-14 hours into the war.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; If you don&#39;t get your first attack in after 8 hours you forfeit that assignment and is fair game for someone else to take it UNLESS you chat and tell us you will be late.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; You MUST specify that you are requesting &#39;War&#39; troops when you are staging your army for a war attack.&nbsp; These troops will have a high priority and you will get max troops per your request.&nbsp; People may even be spending gems on making them so be courteous.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; You MUST opt out of wars when upgrading heros or spell factory.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Most infractions to the rules will get you benched from war until you show that you understand what is expected.</p>
